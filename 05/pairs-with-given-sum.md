# Pairs With a Given Sum

## Problem

Imagine working on software that processes lists of numbers. Create a function named `pairs_with_given_sum` It finds the number of pairs of `numbers` in a list which add up to a given `target`. This function should take in a list of whole `numbers` and a `target` as parameters. This function should have a return value of the integer of number of pairs.

| numbers                 | target | Number of pairs (return value)|
| ----------------------- | --- | --------------- |
| [1, 2, 4, 5]            | 6   | 2               |
| [97, 51, 49, 35, 3, 65] | 100 | 3               |

##### !rubric

The point of this exercise is not fully check if the code is correct at the moment, but to practice writing code outside of a text editor.

- The answer is wrong if it is blank
- The answer is wrong if it is obviously incorrect code (ie writing `print("Oops!")` for the entire response)
