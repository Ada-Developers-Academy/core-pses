# Data Transformation Problem

## Given this problem prompt:

Imagine working on software that tracks students. Create a method that takes in an array of strings that represent student names. This method should return an array of hashes. Each hash should have the name of the student and a student id. The ids should **not** be consecutive numbers.

##### !explanation

Some sample clarifying questions could be:

1.  Is there some pattern required for the student ids?
1.  What key-value pairs should the hashes contain?
1.  What should happen if the array of names is empty?
1.  Can id numbers be negative?
1.  Should ids be Integers or can they be floats?
