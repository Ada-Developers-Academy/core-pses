# Instructor: Activity: Example PSE

The Example PSE is designed to be completed as an activity before PSE 01 is assigned.

A few idea for facilitating the Activity: Example PSE
- Instructor leads
- Students work individually and then review as a class
- Students work in groups and then review as a class

Modeling an Example PSE is new for C17. It would be great for instructors to update this instructor doc with facilitation strategies that work well.
