# Problem Name

## Problem

Imagine working on software that `<TEMPLATE: has some specific kind of purpose and context>`. Create a function named `<TEMPLATE: function name>` that is responsible for `<TEMPLATE: is responsible for what, as a high-level goal?>`. This function should take in `<TEMPLATE: specify data type and what it represents. This needs to be flexible, as question 2 of the PSE is to come up with 2 examples of input>` as a parameter. `<TEMPLATE: function details, if needed>` This function should have a return value of `<TEMPLATE: description of output>`.
