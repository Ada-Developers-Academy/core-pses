# About PSEs

## Introduction

We need to solve problems with other people, whether it's in a whiteboard interview for a new job, or talking through a hard problem with a teammate.

In both of these scenarios, the most important thing is to communicate and display our thought processes while coding. Interviewers and teammates look for the ability to think like a programmer.

But how do we demonstrate that we think like a programmer while solving problems?

We demonstrate how we think like a programmer by:

- Sharing our understanding of the problem
- Asking the right questions
- Talking about coding concepts in multiple different ways
- Solving small coding problems while working towards a bigger solution

## What Are PSEs?

Problem-Solving Exercise assignments (PSEs) are assignments to practice problem-solving skills.

The exercises will touch on problem-solving skills on coding problems. The format has three parts:

1. A problem statement describing the code you need to write
1. A series of questions to guide your understanding of the problem
1. A code challenge to solve the problem

### How to Use PSEs

PSEs will teach us:

- How to go from word problem to code
- How to word the same idea in different ways
- How to ask the right questions
- What to consider when considering edge cases
- How to work with ambiguity

PSE questions are written to guide your thought process through problem-solving.

Each question is purposeful and intentional. **The questions themselves will teach you how to think through the problem**.

When a question is unexpected or challenging for you, write the question down. Then answer for yourself:

- Why was this question unexpected? What does this question touch on that I didn't expect?
- Why was this question challenging? What do I need to do, learn, review, or study so that I can answer this question more easily in the future?

**Constantly reflecting on PSEs** with these two questions **is the strongest way to practice** "thinking like a programmer."

## Notes & Tips

- It's better to slowly work on a PSE every day rather than wait until the last minute.
- Don't procrastinate!
- If the problem statement, question, or option sounds confusing, try re-reading it out loud.
