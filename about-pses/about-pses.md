# About PSEs

## Introduction

We need to solve problems with other people, whether it's in a whiteboard interview for a new job or talking through a hard problem with a teammate.

In both of these scenarios, the most important thing is to communicate and display our thought processes while coding. Interviewers and teammates look for the ability to think like a programmer.

But how do we demonstrate that we think like a programmer while solving problems?

We demonstrate how we think like a programmer by:

- Sharing our understanding of the problem
- Asking the right questions
- Talking about coding concepts in multiple different ways
- Solving small coding problems while working towards a bigger solution

## What Are PSEs?

Problem-Solving Exercise assignments (PSEs) are assignments to practice problem-solving skills.

The exercises will touch on problem-solving skills on coding problems. The format has three parts:

1. A problem statement describing the code you need to write
1. A series of prompts to guide your understanding of the problem and scaffold our solution.
    * i. Ask at least three clarifying questions.
    * ii. Write example input/output and unit tests for at least one nominal and one edge case.
    * iii. Break down the problem into logical steps.   
1. A code challenge to solve the problem

### Learning Goals

PSEs will teach us:

- How to go from word problem to code
- How to word the same idea in different ways
- How to ask the right questions
- What to consider when identifying nominal and edge cases
- How to breakdown an alogirithm into smaller pieces
- How to work with ambiguity
