# About PSEs

## Introduction

For the first week of PSEs, instructors should cover:

- What are PSEs?
- What is the PSE format?
- What tips do we have for PSEs?
- What does an example PSE and submission look like? How does it get reviewed?

## Overview

Problem-Solving Exercise assignments (PSEs) are weekly assignments to practice problem-solving skills.

They are a time-boxed exercise. The exercises will touch on problem-solving skills on coding problems we've seen in the past.

### Growth Over Time

Our PSEs are designed to exercise parts of the brain that aren't often activated. They may start off feeling weird, and often challenging.

These exercises will get more familiar over time. There will be patterns in answers, repetition, and using similar techniques between different problems on different weeks. These exercises will become more smooth as problem-solving skills grow, more context with programming problems increases, and more tools, techniques, and experimentation happens.

# Format of Problem-Solving Exercises

Given this problem prompt:

> If you're given a vague description of some type of input, write code that gives a specific kind of output

Answer the following prompts:

1. List at least 5 questions whose answers would clarify the problem statement
2. List 2 sets of example inputs and their expected output
3. Divide the project prompt into at least 2 different sub-problems
4. Pick one of those problems from #3 and write a numbered list explaining how to solve that problem without using full lines of code
5. Write down on paper a solution for your answer in #4 in code

## Notes & Tips

- This is open note. You are free to use your notes, the Internet, your past projects and assignments, etc!
- For question #1, you will need to list at least five questions. This should feel like a stretch! It should feel really strange and creative to think of this many questions, or more. Sometimes, you'll come up with very weird questions, and that is totally fine, as long as the questions challenge assumptions and are relevant to the problem. Later on in the program, we will encourage you all to aim for 6, 7, or 8 questions.
- For questions #2, #3, #4, and #5, **you will need to make assumptions, and that is okay.** In other words, you will need to answer the questions you wrote in question #1.
- Your assumptions should be consistent throughout the exercise
- What is a sub-problem? Every problem has sub-problems, or smaller problems that need to be solved as part of the original problem.
  - For example, in math, for solving the problem `x = ((8 + 3) * 72) / 2`, some sub-problems would be:
    - How do you isolate problems in parentheses?
    - How do you add?
    - How do you multiply?
    - How do you divide?
- For question #3, your two sub-problems that you list do not need to make up the entire problem.
- For question #5, you are free to write down code that you are seeing from your previous notes, projects, Internet, etc.
- Answer question #5 last. If you need to leave an answer blank, let it be #5.
- These are challenging exercises!
- If your answers from last week seem similar to your answers for this week, that is okay.
