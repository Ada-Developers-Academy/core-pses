# About PSEs

## Introduction

We need to solve problems with other people, whether it's in a whiteboard interview for a new job or talking through a hard problem with a teammate.
- In both of these scenarios, the most important thing is to communicate and display our thought processes while coding. 

Interviewers and teammates look for the ability to think like a programmer. But how do we demonstrate that we think like a programmer while solving problems? We demonstrate how we think like a programmer by:
- Sharing our understanding of the problem
- Asking the right questions
- Talking about coding concepts in multiple different ways
- Solving small coding problems while working towards a bigger solution

## What Are PSEs?

Problem-Solving Exercise assignments (PSEs) are assignments to practice problem-solving skills that we will use in interviews and when communicating about code with others.

Interviews are conducted in a setting that enables discussion and thinking out loud. As a result, the practice in PSEs will be an imperfect approximation, but the act of thinking about and rehearsing how we can word these ideas is valuable preparation. In these exercises, we will write down what would mostly be talked through in an actual interview. 
- During an interview, writing some of the discussion points down can still be useful but our notes there would likely not be to the same level of detail as the responses for PSEs.

These exercises will touch on problem-solving skills for coding problems. The format has three parts:
1. A problem statement describing the code we need to write
2. A series of prompts to guide our understanding of the problem and scaffold a solution:
    1. Describe our understanding of the problem requirements and share any questions we have based on the problem statement and examples
    2. Write example inputs/outputs and unit tests for at least one nominal case and one edge case  
    3. Break down the problem into logical steps
3. A code challenge to solve the problem

### Learning Goals

PSEs help us practice:
- Moving from word problem to code
- Wording the same idea in different ways
- Asking the right questions
- Considering information to identify nominal and edge cases
- Breaking down an alogirithm into smaller pieces
- Working with ambiguity
