# PSE 3 - Hamming

## Given this problem prompt:

Imagine working on software that analyzes mutations in DNA.

Create a method that calculates the number of differences between two DNA strands (aka two strings). This method should take in two different DNA strands as parameters. This method should have a return value of the number of differences between each string. For example, given these two DNA strands (strings), the method should return `7` because there are 7 differences:

```
Strand #1:   GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT
Strand #2:   CATCGTAATGACGGCCT
Differences: ^ ^ ^  ^ ^    ^^
             7 in total
```

1.  What should happen if the array of names is empty?
1.  Can id numbers be negative?
1.  Should ids be Integers or can they be floats?
