# PSE 5 - Pairs with a given sum

## Given this problem prompt:

Imagine working on software that processes lists of numbers. Create a method that determines the number of pairs of numbers in a list which add up to a given sum. This method should take in a list of whole numbers and a given sum as parameters. This method should return the number of pairs in the list which add up to the given sum.

|List  |	Sum |	Number of pairs |
|---  |--- |--- |
| [1, 2, 4, 5] | 	6 |	2 |
| [97, 51, 49, 35, 3, 65] |	100 |	3 |
