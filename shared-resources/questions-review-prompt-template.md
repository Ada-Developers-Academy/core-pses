# Template for Clarifying Questions Review

I am a software development student studying Python. I am practicing how to break down a coding problem. I am currently focusing on asking clarifying questions about a problem space based on the problem description and examples.

I would like assistance reviewing the questions that I came up with about a coding problem. I want to ensure that the questions I've written provide new information about the problem space and that my reasoning for asking the questions makes sense in the context of the problem. 

The problem statement and examples are below:
Problem Statement:
```

```

Examples:
```

```

Given the problem statement and examples above, please review the list of my questions about the problem and my reasoning for asking them below. In your answer, do not include any code or implementation information about the problem. Assume that input validation is handled ahead of this function unless it is explicitly mentioned in the problem statement or examples, the focus should be on the core of the problem. I only want to focus on asking questions to clarify the problem. I would also like to hear about other questions that would help clarify the problem. For any new questions, please share information about why we would want to ask that new question, and what we would learn about the problem from asking it.

My Questions:
```
1. My question 1
    - My reasoning for question 1
2. My question 2
    - My reasoning for question 2
3. My question 3
    - My reasoning for question 3
