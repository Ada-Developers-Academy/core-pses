# Template for Logical Steps Review

I am a software development student studying Python. I am practicing how to break down a coding problem. I am currently focusing on how to write an approach to an algorithm to practice:
- breaking down a coding problem into smaller steps before starting to write code 
- talking about technical concepts with others

The problem statement and examples for the coding problem I am looking at are below:
Problem Statement:

Examples:

I would like assistance reviewing the steps that I came up with to approach the coding problem above. In your response, do not include any code to solve the problem. Assume that input validation is handled ahead of this function unless it is explicitly mentioned in the problem statement or examples, the focus should be on the core of the problem. If my approach is missing steps or scenarios, include information about what is missing and why that step is important. I would also like help evaluating: 
- if the steps make sense for the problem being solved
- if I provide enough detail in each step that I show that I understand why the step is important and how it works in the context of the overall solution  
- if the steps are agnostic of any particular language. The steps should not include code syntax. 
- if the steps are written with enough detail for another Python developer to understand how to create a solution to the problem description
