# PSE 6 - Merging Sorted Lists

## Given this problem prompt:

Imagine working on software that processes lists of numbers. Create a method takes two sorted lists and merges them into a single sorted list. This method should take in two lists of whole numbers. The method should return a new sorted list which consists of the elements of the two arguments.


| List 1 | List 2 | Output |
|--- |--- | --- |
| [1, 2, 4, 5] | [6] | [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
| [-30, -10, 0, 15, 16] | [-20, -5, 5] | [-30, -20, -10, -5, 0, 5, 15, 16] |

Some sample clarifying questions could be:

1.  Is there some pattern required for the student ids?
1.  What key-value pairs should the hashes contain?
1.  What should happen if the array of names is empty?
1.  Can id numbers be negative?
1.  Should ids be Integers or can they be floats?
