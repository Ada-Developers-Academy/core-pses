# Merging Sorted Lists

## Problem

Imagine working on software that processes lists of numbers. Create a function named `merge_lists` that takes two sorted lists and merges them into a single sorted list. This function should take in two lists of whole numbers. The function should return a new sorted list which consists of the elements of the two arguments.

| List 1                | List 2       | Output                            |
| --------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| [1, 2, 4, 5]          | [6]          | [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]                   |
| [-30, -10, 0, 15, 16] | [-20, -5, 5] | [-30, -20, -10, -5, 0, 5, 15, 16] |

The point of this exercise is not fully check if the code is correct at the moment, but to practice writing code outside of a text editor.

- The answer is wrong if it is blank
- The answer is wrong if it is obviously incorrect code (ie writing `print("Oops!")` for the entire response)
